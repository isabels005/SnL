Hi! Welcome to Snakes and Ladders.
As of this moment, the game is incomplete.
The snakes don't send you down, the ladders don't send you up.
But what DOES work is the dice...and movement? (Kinda)
Ok, movement is kinda busted, but it can still cause the "movement" across the board.
It's techincally 2 player, but really...it's 1. Sorry about that.

Controls:
-Left Click to Roll Dice (That moves the player however many spaces when you...)
-Right Click to "move" player. Again, it's a bit busted. Also, if you land on the end, it sends you back to the beginning of the next row.

P.S: Rolling the dice does not automatically move you, to move, right click.

If you reach the end, you will get an error. Consider that your win?
Oh also, the numbers are messy. You should get the idea though.
